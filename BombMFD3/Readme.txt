Hi. This is bomb MFD. 
It generates bombs. The bombs will dystroy anything that's within the damage radius, which is fully 
configurable by the user. The MFD will also render any vessel useless which is twice the distance of the Damage radius, when 
the bomb explodes. 
DON't blow yourself up with your own bomb, you have been warned!

Key Map:

SHIFT + V: Select bomb dyployment mode. 
SHIFT + C: Toggle constant bomb generation
SHIFT + B: Release a single bomb
SHIFT + E: Send a command to all bombs, and tell them to explode!
SHIFT + [: Increase delay by a second
SHIFT + ]: Decrease delay by a second
SHIFT + =: Increase Damage radius
SHIFT + -: Decrease Damage radius
SHIFT + F: Fire Missile

UPDATES:

Now Bomb MFD fires missiles
MFD buttons added
General bug fixing


Now, we have 2 deployment modes. "Explode at Contact", and "Explode at command".
You can toggle them with SHIFT + V. To use the first one, make sure that you are high enough so when you drop the bomb, it doesn't 
immediatly hit he ground. Once you are high enough, drop the bomb. When the bomb hits the ground, it explodes, dystroying anything
in the 250 meters radius. To use the later, drop, first choose the "Explode at Command" with SHIFT + V. Once it displays that on the screen,
drop a bomb or two. Once you are out of the bombs range, press SHIFT + E, and watch them explode. Remember, with this method, you can 
stay near a bomb as long as you don't press SHIFT + E. The bomb will only explode once that command has been sent. 
If it says "EXPLODE!" on the MFD, DO NOT CREATE ANOTHER BOMB! Wait for the messege to disappear, then create bombs. 

You can toggle constant bomb generation, but be careful, as this feature is a bit dangerous and buggy. 

To release just a single bomb, press SHIFT + B. Make sure you don't create any bombs when the "EXPLODE!" messege is on the screen.

Damage radius implimentation. 

Delay controls the time the bomb will explode, after the bomb hits the ground. 
Delay of 0 will light the bomb immediatly after it hits the ground. A delay of 10 will light the bomb
10 seconds after ground collision.
Now, there is a bomb limit. You can configure it in the ini file, which is
in Modules\\Plugin. BombMFD.ini. Change the BombLimit to any whole number :)

NOTE!!!:
DO NOT HAVE MORE THEN ONCE INSTANCE OF THE MFD OPENED AT THE SAME TIME!!!

Have fun!
