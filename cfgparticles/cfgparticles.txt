Hello. This plugin allows you to add particle streams to simple cfg defined vessels. 
Look at the root/config/particles/Deltaglider.cfg for an example of how to create your own. 
Look at the Orbiter API reference in order to find what each parameter stands for. 
The name of the cfg file must be the same as the classname of of the vessel in question. 
If the vessel does not have a classname, the name of the cfg file should be the same as the name of the vessel.
