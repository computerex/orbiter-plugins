Hi. AutoHover MFD is a simple MFD that will give every vessel some handy autopilots.

Currently supported autopilots:

Pitch hold
Bank  Hold (RCS only)
velocity hold
vertical velocity hold
AOA holder

USAGE:

Activate the MFD, set the autopilot configurations to your liking, and then you can close the MFD or switch it with any other. 
Each vessel gets it's own autopilots, so you can have multiple autopilots running in different vessels simultaneously. 
The pitch and bank autopilots have only been tested with the stock dg, but they 
should work with any other vessel. You may see some jittering. Switch camera mode to "Global Frame".

KEY MAP:

SHIFT + = sign ("<>" button) : Cycles the selected autopilot 
SHIFT + S      ("TGT" button): set the target value (ie. the value you want the autopilot to reach for the specified autopilot)
SHIFT + T      ("TGL" button): Toggle autopilot
SHIFT + C      ("TAL" button): Set weather the vessel is a tail sitter. If the vessel is a tail sitter, the autopilot will use the main engines for
                               vertical velocity hold
SHIFT + [      ("INC" button): Increase the target by step
SHIFT + ]      ("DEC" button): Decrease the target by step
SHIFT + I      ("++"  button): Increase step by 1
SHIFT + D      ("--"  button): Decrease step by 1
SHIFT + H      ("HLT" button): Immediatly stops all autopilots and activates killrot 

NOTE::->

The pitch autopilot might not work for some vessels
If the ship is a tail sitter, do not use the cruise autopilot while the vertical velocity hold autopilot is active,
as they will fight to gain control of the main engine. 

The AOA holder only fires the pitch thrusters for holding the aoa, so you will have to maintain the bank
and yaw by yourself, you can have the bank autopilot  maintain the bank. The pitch autopilot and the aoa
autopilot should not be on at the same time. 

INSTALL:

Simply extract this archive in Orbiter's main directory keeping the directory structure in
tact. 

Please do not activate the autopilot when time warp is above 1x. 

You will need the VC++ 2005 runtime components in order for this MFD to work.
