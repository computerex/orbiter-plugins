Hi. This addon lets users teleport in Orbiter. Each teleporter vessel acts like a teleportation point,
and a teleporter. IE. The teleporters teleport you to OTHER teleporter vessels. USAGE:

Keys:

[ = Enter the name of the teleporter vessel the teleporter will teleport to
D = Set the teleportation distance field

Quick Start scenario:

The teleporter at KSC landing pad is all set to teleport you to teleporter 1, which is in LEO. 
The teleportation distance field is set to 20 meters. So simply fly your GL-01 to within 20 meters
of the teleporter, and you will be teleported to teleporter 1. Teleporter 1 is set to teleport
you to teleporter 2. Teleporter 2 is set to teleport you to teleporter 3, and teleporter 3 will teleport 
you back on cape canaveral. 

Sorry for the crappy teleporter mesh, I am not an artist. If anybody feels up to it, they can 
modify the mesh or create a new one, and upload it. You may modify this addon any way you please. 

You need the vC++ 2005 runtime components in order to run this addon. Get them here:
