Hi. This module enables a user to customize the look of reentry. You use an ini file to define
particle streams for individual vessels, and you give a heat flux threshold so the module knows
when to render them. If you have no idea what a heat flux is, just set the heatFlux value to "default".
The inis are found in orbiter\Config\orbReentryStream folder. Two ini's are included as an example,
one for the DG, and the other for the DGIV. 

To install, extract this folder in orbiter's main directory keeping the directory structure in tact. 
Then activate the module under orbiter's launchpad. 
You may need the VC++ 2005 runtime components in order for this add-on to function. Get them here:

Here's a tutorial for defining particle streams by Art Eaton:

srcsize - particle size at creation [m] .................how big the particles start when created
srcrate - average particle creation rate [Hz]...............how many particles are made per second
v0 - emission velocity [m/s]................................how fast the particles move in meters per second
srcspread - velocity spread during creation....................What the variation of the particle speed is a defined by "v0"
lifetime - average particle lifetime.................................Approximately how long the particles exist for
growthrate - particle growth rate [m/s]............................How fast the particles grow
atmslowdown - slowdown rate in atmosphere.....................how fast the particles slow down from the speed defined by "v0"
LTYPE - EMISSIVE, DIFFUSE render lighting method....................Emissive means the smoke is bright and hot looking. Diffuse is like black dark smoke.
LEVELMAP - LVL_FLAT, LVL_LIN, LVL_SQRT, LVL_PLIN, LVL_PSQRT mapping from level to alpha ...............As your thruster setting increases, the smoke gets thicker. The function by which this does that is either flat (unchanging) linear(increases directly with the thruster setting) or by it's square root (increases to many mtimes the volume as the setting gets higher). The last to possible values: LVL_PLIN & LVL_PSQRT are linear and square root increases within a set defined range
lmin - min for the PLIN and PQSRT mapping types................
lmax - max for the PLIN and PSQRT mapping types................ These are the minimum and maximum values for the LVL_PLIN, LVL_PSQRT options above. It is not always used
ATMSMAP - ATM_FLAT, ATM_PLIN, ATM_PLOG mapping from atmospheric params to alpha... like the LEVELMAP above, but for the thickness of the atmosphere (altitude) instead of the thruster level
amin, amax - min and max densities for atms PLIN mapping minimum and maximum values for the density of the atmosphere required to start making smoke. If you set the amin to zero, you will produce smoke on the moon or in space.
tex - name of exhaust texture. SET NONE if not using any texture

pos - where the particle stream will be rendered relative to the vessel
dir - the direction of the particle stream, has to be normalized
heatFlux - the heat flux threshold
