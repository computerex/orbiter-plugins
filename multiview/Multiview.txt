Hi. This add-on allows you to define additional internal camera views. To install, extract this pack in Orbiter's directory
keeping the structure in tact. Then activate the module under orbiter's launchpad. 

USAGE:

To add views to a vessel, create a cfg file with the view parameters inside Orbiter\config\MutltiView directory.
The name of the cfg file must correspond with class name of the vessel the file is for. If the vessel is a spacecraftX.dll vessel,
the name of the cfg file must be the same as the ini of that vessel. 

CFG format:

ViewCount=3   ; number of additonal views
CAM_1_Pos=10 0 0 ; position relative to the vessel where the camera is located [x, y, z]
CAM_1_dir=0 1 0

CAM_2_Pos=-10 0 0
CAM_2_dir=0 0 1

CAM_3_Pos=-0.7 1.15 5.55
CAM_3_dir=0 0 1

To switch between different views, while inside simulation, press CTRL + F4, then double click on "Camera Views".

In order for this add-on to function, you need to have the VC++ 2005 runtime components installed. Get them here:

You may re-distribute this add-on with custom add-on packages.
