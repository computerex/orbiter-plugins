Hi. This is an orbital scenery generation module. 
It creates/deletes vessels. To install, extract this archive
in orbiter's top directory, keeping the structure in tact. 
Make sure you activate the roid module under orbiter's launchpad. 

Customize this module with Modules\Plugin\roid.ini file

[SETTINGS]
; How many vessels will be rendered at one time?
count=100
; random meshes. To make the scenery objects look different from each other
mesh_count=1
mesh_1_name=phobos
; If the scenery object's rel pos is bigger (or the other way around)
; then any of these 3 values, it is deleted
destroy_ofs=(1000,500,1000)
; maximum limits relative to the vessel in local coordinates. 
; The real values will be randomized
create_ofs=(1000,500,1000)
; so the vessels created won't be in a straight line
; scenery objects velocity relative to the focus vessel
relvel=(0,0,-120)
; "Create scenery objects if focus altitude is above 300 km"
renderalt=300

Limitations:

vessels are always created from the focus's z+ direction.
