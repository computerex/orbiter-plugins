Hi. This is FlyByViewMFD. It's a simple attempt to implement a fly by view in Orbiter.The system inline
with Orbiter is essentially useless for vessels traveling at high speeds. 

What this MFD does is create a dummy camera vessel to provide the fly by view.
The user provides the relative velocity vector, and the position relative to the vessel(s)
you are trying to get the fly by view of. With these 2 simple options, you can get some 
cool fly by views. 

UPDATE:
FlyByView MFD now has vessel tracking capability.
MFD buttons have been added
Smooth FOV change

USAGE:

SHIFT + [ = Change vessel target
SHIFT + ] = Toggle tracking
SHIFT + P = Specify the position vector
SHIFT + V = Specify the velocity vector
SHIFT + F = Activate fly by
SHIFT + R = Revert to old camera view

While in Fly by:

use NUMPAD and NUMPAD2 for smooth FOV change

Example:

Say I want a fly by shot of a Deltaglider in Orbiter, coming from behind the camera to the front.
Say I want the "camera" to be 2 meters above the Deltaglider, 200 meters in front of it, and a relative velocity of -30 m/s to 
make the glider come from behind me. 

For the pos vector, I would enter: 0 2 200
For the vel vector, I would enter: 0 0 -30

Say I also want the camera to move right at 2 m/s, the vel vector would change to: 2 0 -30

Special thanks to Artlav for helping me implement the vessel tracking

To use this addon, you must have the VC++ 2005 express edition runtime components, which you can get here:
