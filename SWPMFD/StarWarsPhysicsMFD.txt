Hi. This MFD implements star wars physics and some other features to every vessel.
To install, extract in Orbiter's main directory keeping the structure in tact. Then activate
the module under orbiter's launchpad.

USAGE::

SHIFT + P - Increase velocity by the vel. gain factor [m/s]
SHIFT + S - Set the vel.gain factor
SHIFT + T - Toggle star wars physics (go where you point)
SHIFT + C - Toggle constant propogation
SHIFT + F -  Fire blaster
SHIFT + V - Set the blaster relative velocity
SHIFT + R - Set blaster's explosion range in meters
Accelerate towards a planet, then either do spins to slow down, or enter a negative value for the vel.gain factor. 

The blasters "explode" when a vessel is within the specified range. When you hit a vessel, it bounces.
The bigger the range, the bigger the blasters. 

NOTE: The blasters defy gravity. The physics behind the objects getting hit is unrealistic. 

In order for this add-on to function, you need the VC++ 2005 runtime components. Get them here:

Thanks to Jacob Larsen for the math behind the modified physics.
