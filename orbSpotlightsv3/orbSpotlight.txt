Hi. This simple module allows you to add "lights" and beacons to vessels. Simply create a 
ini file with the parameters (below), name it with the title of the class name of that 
particular vessel, and drop it in the config\spotlights folder. The "lights" automatically
turn themselves off when time acceleration is taking place, or if it's night or day. They turn themselves back on wthen it's done. 

Look at the Config\spotlights\Dragonfly.ini and ShuttleA.ini files
for examples. 

To install, simply extract this pack in orbiter's top directory keeping the directory 
structure in tact. Then activate the orbSpotlight module under the launchpad's modules tab. 

To find the class name of a vessel, open it's configuration file (usually in config\vessels), 
and it should be there. 

NOTE: For spacecraft*.dll type vessels, the name of the ini must be the name of the spacecraft*.dll in
      the scenario you are launching. 

Special thanks to "BEEP" from the M6 forums for providing the ini files for ShuttleA and Dragonfly. 

cheers
