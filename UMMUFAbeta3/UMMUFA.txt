Hi. This is the release of UMMUFA (UMMU for all). This release comes with some new features. The most
important of them being is that now the system takes care of saving the state of the ships registered to it. 

UMMUFA is an "extension" to Dan Steph's Universal MMU system. You HAVE to install UMMU prior to installing this
add-on. You can get it here: orbiter.dansteph.com

This "extension" allows you to add UMMU capability in every vessel. 

To install, simply extract this package in orbiter's main directory keeping the directory structure in tact. 
You can configure the system by modifying the Modules\UMMUFA.cfg file. The parameters you can modify are 
explained there. 

USAGE:

UMMUFA uses configuration files for setting vessel parameters. Here's an example of how to make ShuttleA UMMU compatible
by using UMMUFA:

These instructions assume that you have already installed Orbitersound 3.5, UMMUFA, and UMMU.

1. Start the standard "checklist\Quickstart.scn" scenario.
2. Switch focus to SH-03
3. Press TAB + D. A dialog will pop up. Enter the ship data. 
   
PosP = vector that defines the positive values of the imaginary box that defines the airlock shape
PosN = vector that defines the negative values of the imaginary box that defines the airlock shape
Pos   =  Where the EVA will appear relative to the vessel
rot   = orientation of the EVA relative to the vessel

4. Once done entering the data, press press "Create CFG", and close the dialog box

Now a cfg file is automatically generated inside Orbiter\Config\UMMUFA folder. Every vessel of that type will now be UMMUFA compatible.
You can add crew members by pressing TAB + LEFT ARROW KEY. You can also save a scenario using that dialog box. When you save a scenario,
a newly generated scenario file will be created in orbiter\scenarios\ folder. A CFG file will be created in Orbiter\scenarios\ummufa folder. The newly
generated scenario file will point to the newly generated cfg file. If you decide to move the newly generated cfg file to another location, make sure
you update the path of that file inside the scenario. The path is specified by the "CFG" field inside the begin_UMMUFA and end_UMMUFA section. 

NOTE: You only need to make the cfg file one time. Just remember this. If you press TAB + LEFT ARROW KEY, and a dialog box doesn't pop up,
you need to create a cfg file. Otherwise, you don't. Again, to create a cfg file, press TAB + D.

KEYS:

TAB + UP ARROW KEY - EVA
TAB + = - Select next member
TAB + - - select next airlock
TAB + RIGHT ARROW KEY - switch focus to the last evaed member
TAB + D - open CFG file generator dialog
TAB + LEFT ARROW KEY - Open "Add Crew Member" dialog box
TAB + E - eject

I have taken the liberty to make the stock Deltaglider UMMU compatible using this system. Any time you want to add crew members, simply 
press TAB + LEFT ARROW KEY. You can save scenarios using that dialog box as well.

UMMUFA creates a cfg file titled "CurrentState.cfg" within the orbiter\scenarios\UMMUFA folder. That file is made whenever orbiter
saves state. NOTE: If you quick save using CTRL + S, THE UMMUFA STATES WILL NOT BE SAVED! If you want to save a scenario 
using UMMUFA, save is using the Add Crew member dialog by pressing TAB + LEFT ARROW KEY.

You need VC++ 2005 runtome components in order for this add-on to work properly. Get it here:
