Hi. This module adds a dust kick off effect for vessels with hover engines. To install, extract this archive
in orbiter's top directory keeping the directory structure in tact.If your altitude is below that of the offset defined 
in the Modules\Plugin\orbHoverDust.ini, it will simulate dust kick off. The particle stream for the dust effect c
an be configured using the same ini.

Particle parameters:

srcsize     - particle size at creation [m]
srcrate     - average particle creation rate [Hz]
v0          - emission velocity [m/s]
srcspread   - velocity spread during creation
lifetime    - average particle lifetime
growthrate  - particle growth rate [m/s]
atmslowdown - slowdown rate in atmosphere
LTYPE       - EMISSIVE, DIFFUSE render lighting method
LEVELMAP    - LVL_FLAT, LVL_LIN, LVL_SQRT, LVL_PLIN, LVL_PSQRT mapping from level to alpha
lmin        - min for the PLIN and PQSRT mapping types
lmax        - max for the PLIN and PSQRT mapping types
ATMSMAP     - ATM_FLAT, ATM_PLIN, ATM_PLOG  mapping from atmospheric params to alpha
amin, amax  - min and max densities for atms PLIN mapping
tex         - name of exhaust texture. SET NONE if not using any texture (recommended)
alt_ofs     - "if altitude is below this value, render the effect" defined in meters
For more information, look in the Orbiter API documentation.

bug fixes:

* fixed the CTD when a new stage is created in a vessel
* Dynamically created vessels are now registered
