Hi. This MFD allows you to move fuel from vessel to vessel, refuel your tanks, and dump fuel.
Multiple fuel transfers can be done simultaneously. To install, extract this archive in orbiter's root
directory keeping the directory structure in tact. Then activate the module under orbiter's launchpad
to use the MFD. Once you have opened the MFD, press the MNU button and HLP button to get 
help.
