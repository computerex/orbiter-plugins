Hi. This pack adds at least 1 base to every planet and moon in Orbiter. To install, simply extract this page in Orbiter's top
directory keeping the directory structure in tact, overwriting any files. 

Special thanks to markl316 for keeping a back up of these bases, without him I wouldn't have been
able to upload this pack to orbithangar.

regards
