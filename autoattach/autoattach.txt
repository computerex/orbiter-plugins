Hello. This is AutoAttach, it's a plugin that makes attachment points emulate docking behavior. Unlike docking,
attachment points can only be attached using API calls. With this plugin active however, if you bring a attachment point
within 1 meter of another point, and assuming one point is parent and the other is child, they will automatically get attached. 
If you want to free a child, switch focus to it, and open up "AutoAttach Manager MFD", and hit Shift+A. The plug-in only scans
for vessels that need attachments when scanning is enabled. This is for compatibility, and to reduce the impact on FPS. 
Just open the AutoAttach Manager MFD, and toggle scanning using Shift + S.
